## 📖 How It Works: "A Day in the Life of a Fault"
Imagine a vehicle on the highway. Here is how AuroSys handles a critical failure in **4 seconds**:

1.  **0.0s (The Event)**: A "Rod Knock" vibration pattern is detected by the **Telematics Agent** (400Hz Sensor Stream).
2.  **0.1s (Edge Inference)**: The **Diagnosis Agent** analyzes the waveform locally. It recognizes the pattern: *"High Severity Fault detected."*
3.  **0.5s (Bandwidth Optimization)**: The **Comms Module** wakes up. Instead of sending GBs of data, it packages a concise **1.5MB Blackbox Dump** (JSON + Waveform) to the cloud.
4.  **1.2s (Cloud Forensics)**: The **RCA Agent** receives the payload. It queries the Manufacturing Database and finds a match: *"This VIN matches Batch-2023-A, known for weak connecting rod bearings."*
5.  **2.0s (Supply Chain)**: The **Inventory Agent** instantly scans 4 regional warehouses. *Result: Part in stock at Chennai Hub.*
6.  **2.5s (Costing)**: The **Financial Agent** calculates the total bill: *Part (₹12,500) + Labor (₹1,500) = ₹14,000.*
7.  **3.0s (Logistics)**: The **Scheduling Agent** reserves a service bay at the nearest "Hero Hub" workshop.
8.  **3.5s (User Loop)**: The **Driver App** buzzes. *Message: "Critical Issue Detected. Service booked at Indiranagar. Part reserved. Est Cost: ₹14k."*

**Result**: A potential engine seizure is prevented, the part is reserved, and the user is calm—all before the car even stops rolling.

## 💰 Business Impact (Why EY & OEMs Care)
*   **For OEMs**: Reduced Warranty Fraud & Recall Costs. (Targeted batch recalls vs global recalls).
*   **For Supply Chain**: Just-In-Time (JIT) inventory management triggered by predictive diagnostics.
*   **For Drivers**: Increased safety and transparent repair costs (No more "Mechanic Shock").

---

## 🚀 The Problem
Modern vehicles generate TBs of data, but:
1.  **Mechanics** lack context-aware tools to diagnose complex issues.
2.  **OEMs** struggle to correlate individual faults with supply chain defects.
3.  **Drivers** receive cryptic error codes instead of actionable advice.

## 💡 The Solution: AuroSys
AuroSys is a **Hybrid Agentic Architecture** that combines:
*   **Edge AI (In-Car)**: Real-time sensor processing and immediate safety alerts (Privacy-First).
*   **Cloud AI (OEM)**: Root Cause Analysis (RCA), Supply Chain integration, and Predictive Maintenance.
*   **Security AI (Watchdog)**: Real-time Financial UEBA and Policy enforcement to prevent fraud.
*   **Human-Centric UI**: A 3D Digital Twin for engineers and a Companion App for drivers.

> **Key Innovation**: We move from "Rule-Based Alerts" (Check Engine Light) to **"Agentic Reasoning"** (Diagnostics + Logistics + Finance).

## ✨ Key Features (Winning Factors)

### 1. 🎧 NVH Forensics (Signal Core)
*   **3D Waterfall Spectrogram**: Visualizes "Order Analysis" (RPM vs. Frequency) with a red **ISO 10816 Violation Plane** to instantly spot dangerous resonance.
*   **Signal Core Metrics**: Real-time calculation of **Kurtosis**, **Crest Factor**, and **Dominant Frequency** to fingerprint fault signatures.
*   **Physics-Based**: Unlike basic charts, this tracks harmonic orders (1x, 2x RPM) to distinguish between unbalance and mechanical looseness.
    > **💰 OEM Benefit**: Instead of recalling *every* car for a "noisy engine," engineers can see that **Batch-B** has a unique *2x Order resonance*, pinpointing a specific supplier defect (e.g., "Misaligned Flywheel"). This precision **reduces recall scope by 90%**.

## 🧠 The "Hybrid Decision Engine" (Strategic Logic)
Unlike typical dashboards that just show error codes, AuroSys uses a novel **Hybrid Architecture** to function as an autonomous OEM consultant.

### How It Works (Code Structure)
The decision logic is decoupled into three layers to ensure deterministic accuracy and scalable UI:
1.  **The Brain (`core.py`)**: A pure logic engine that maps fault types to fleet metadata (e.g., *Rod Knock = Batch-2023-A*).
2.  **The Face (`ui_lib.py`)**: A presentation layer that calculates financial impact models (Global Risk vs. Targeted Cost).
3.  **The Controller (`ui_app.py`)**: Orchestrates the handoff between the diagnosis agent and the strategic recommendation engine.

### 🏆 Three Business Realities (The "Trifecta")
AuroSys autonomously handles the three most critical scenarios in the automotive industry:

| Scenario | Fault Detected | System Decision | Business Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. The Crisis** | **Rod Knock** (Critical) | **🚨 TARGETED BATCH RECALL** | Prevents total fleet recall. Saves **₹48.8 Cr** by isolating *Batch-2023-A*. |
| **2. The Glitch** | **Misfire** (Software) | **📡 FIRMWARE OTA ROLLOUT** | Identifies regional software bug. Deploys patch for **₹0.05 Cr** (vs ₹12 Cr service cost). |
| **3. The Wear** | **Loose Mount** (Mechanical) | **🔧 PHYSICAL INSPECTION** | Recognizes non-systemic wear. Recommends standard maintenance. **Zero Panic.** |
